          <h3>VESAK FESTIVAL</h3>
          <div class="content1">
            <p class="para1">
              Vesak, also known as Vesakha or Buddha Day, is a significant
              festival in Sri Lanka and is celebrated to commemorate the birth,
              enlightenment, and passing away of Gautama Buddha. This festival
              is observed on the full moon day in May and is one of the most
              important religious events in Sri Lanka. The celebrations begin a
              week before the actual day, and people all over the country engage
              in various activities to mark the occasion. Decorations of
              colorful lanterns are made, and Buddhist temples are adorned with
              colorful lights and ornaments. People also participate in charity
              work, offering food to the less fortunate, and giving alms to
              monks. One of the most important Vesak customs is the Dansalas,
              where food and drinks are distributed freely to passers-by,
              irrespective of their race, caste or religion. The streets are
              illuminated with colorful lights, and Buddhists flock to the
              temples to offer flowers and light oil lamps, praying for peace
              and harmony in the world. Another important activity during Vesak
              is the creation of pandals or Vesak thoranas, which are temporary
              structures built to depict scenes from the life of the Buddha.
              These pandals are adorned with colorful lights and decorations and
              are a major attraction for visitors from all over the country.
              Overall, Vesak is a festival that brings people together,
              regardless of their race or religion, to celebrate peace, harmony,
              and the teachings of the Buddha. It is a time for reflection,
              offering thanks, and spreading joy and goodwill to all.
